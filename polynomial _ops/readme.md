In this simple project, I employed a linked-list to create a polynomial manipulation
application.

The application has an addition, multiplication and subtraction function.

**Limitations**
There are several limittaions to the current implementation:
* Create a separate main function to accept user input.
* Add a division module.
* Refactor code.
