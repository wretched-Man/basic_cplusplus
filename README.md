# basic_cplusplus
Standalone, C++ practice programs.

This repo contains 'basic' as in non-complicated C++ problems that I solved while
getting a hang of problem-solving and the language. Each *.cpp* file is standalone (with its own **main()**) and all (unless specified below)
use C++11 and above and the Standard Library.

The challenges are pulled **primarily** from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/problems/). Within each file is a link to the problem and documentation
of the steps.
