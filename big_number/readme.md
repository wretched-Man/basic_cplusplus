This is a big number project built from a linked-list.

It contains methods for addition, subtraction and multiplication.

**Limitations**
There are various limitations, including:
* For multiplication, one of the operands must be able at most 18 digits long.
* For larger numbers, the toom-cook multiplication algorithm should be used - it has not been implemented.
* Create a separate main function to accept user input.
