/*
  The problem reads:

  Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in 
  x units of time, he finishes it in mâˆ—x units of time. But there is always a 
  limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max d units of time. Given 
  x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.
